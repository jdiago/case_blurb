#CaseBlurb for LegalFile - AT&T Hackathon August 2012

LegalFile for iPad brings lawyers up-to-date and into the world of mobile
technology. It allows litigators to manage their cases, case documents and
client information while on-the-go, digitally with the Apple iPad.

For this hosting of the AT&T Hackathon in Miami, Esenem, LLC., LegalFile's
parent company propositioned developers to propose an aspect of collaboration
that could benefit the LegalFile product. This GitHub project, CaseBlurb,
showcases that. 

CaseBlurb allows for live messages to be trasmitted between users about cases
they are privy to. All messages transmitted are broadcast live and also logged
for later review if one or more users are not available to receive the message
live.

CaseBlurb is built on Ruby on Rails, integrates Twitter Bootstrap and was
developed by @jdiago and @mrdazm under the senseis-ship of @mcnamarasean and
@bonzoesc.
